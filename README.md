# Navi-Assistant

Navi is an OpenAI assistant manager which allows you to quickly create assistants with useful tools and query them.

## Features
### Global & Local Assistants
Navi creates a "global" and "local" assistants. The global assistant is a system-wide assistant, whereas local assistants are perticular to a specific directory.  
When using Navi, the global assistant is used by default, when there is not an local Navi configuration in the current directory.  

This lets users create specific assistant configurations for any work/project.

### Easy Assistant Tooling
Navi configurations (both global and local) can be setup with tools to enhance the capability of the assistant. Sets of tools are managed via Github repositories (e.g.: https://github.com/NixonInnes/Navi-Assistant-Tools-Linux).  
Tools are simply added by cloning the repository into the assistants tools directory.  

This lets users create managed sets of tools, that are also shareable.

### Vector File Store Management
Navi can be configured to include specific directories and file extensions to sync with a vector file store associated to the assistant. 

A simple `sync` command lets users keep relevent files up to date for the assistant to search.

## Installation

### Requirements
 - Python 3.12+
 - curl
