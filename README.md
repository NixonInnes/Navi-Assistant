# Navi-Assistant

Navi is an OpenAI assistant manager which allows you to quickly create assistants with useful tools and query them.

## Features
### Global & Local Assistants
Navi allows for a "global" and "local" assistants. The global assistant is used when there is not an `.navi` configuration in the current directory.  
This lets users create specific assistant configurations; e.g. a coding project assistant

### Easy Assistant Tooling
Navi configurations (both global and local) can be setup with tools to enhance the capability of the assistant. Sets of tools are managed via Github repositories (like: https://github.com/NixonInnes/Navi-Assistant-Tools-Linux).  
This lets users create managed sets of tools, that are also shareable.

### Vector File Store Management
Navi can be configured to include directories and file extension to sync with a vector file store associated to the assistant. A simple `sync` command lets users keep relevent files up to date for the assistant to search.
